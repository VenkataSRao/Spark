Accumulators:
==============

When working with spark transformations, variable can define outside driver program, but each task running on the cluster
gets new copy of the variable and updates from this copy or not propogated back to the driver..

Accumulators are one type of shared variables which avoids above restrictions and aggregates information for worker nodes
and back to the driver program..



Broadcasr variables:
=====================

Spark's second type of shared variables allows program to efficiently send a large, read only value to all the worker nodes for
use one or more spark operation..

Broadcast variables are read only copy or used as a lookup table

These varialbes are inefficient when
  1. tasks launching mechanism is optimised for small task sizes will be overhead..
  2. Using same varialbe in multiple parallel operaton, spark will send separately for each operation..
