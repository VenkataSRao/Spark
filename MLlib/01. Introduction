MLlib is Spark’s scalable machine learning library consisting of common learning algorithms and utilities, including 
classification, regression, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, as well as underlying optimization 
primitives. 

The API is divided into 2 parts:

The original spark.mllib API is the primary API.
The “Pipelines” spark.ml API is a higher-level API for constructing ML workflows.
