Spark MLlib has below data types..

  Local vector
  Labeled point
  Local matrix
  Distributed matrix
    RowMatrix
    IndexedRowMatrix
    CoordinateMatrix
    BlockMatrix
    
    
    
    MLlib supports local vectors and matrices stored on a single machine, as well as distributed matrices backed by one or more 
    RDDs. 
    
    Local vectors and local matrices are simple data models that serve as public interfaces. The underlying linear algebra 
    operations are provided by Breeze and jblas.
