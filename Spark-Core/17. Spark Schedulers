Spark has below 3 schedulers

Standalone Scheduler ( default )
YARN
Mesos

Standalone Scheduler:
============================
It uses spark's scheduling and it is distributed

Spark has 2 schedules
    DAG
    Task scheduler
DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is responsible for spark job into stages and decides the number of tasks to be executed within a stage.. This info will passes to task scheduler
Task Scheduler: It is responsible for launching the tasks and re-starting the task if there is any failure.. (default:4)
Spark core will take care of standalone..

YARN:
=======
In this, Spark job will run in YARN mode..
YARN Daemons ( AM, RM and NM ) will take care of spark job...

  AM - Application Manager
  RM - Resource Manager
  NM - Node Manager
  
  
  MESOS:
  ========
  
  This is same as YARN...
