Transformations on dstreans are either stateless or stateful

Stateless Transformations:
=========================

In stateless transformations processing of each batch doesnot depend on the data of the previous batch.

[rdd-rdd1-rdd2----] rdd2 is not dependent on rdd1.

These are common transformations like map filter reduce by key, flat map, repartition, group by key,union, count, reduce, 
count by value, join,co group.

although this transformations seen to be applied on dstream, they will be applied separately, to each RDD, within Dstream. 
For example, reduce by key reduces, data within each time step, but not across time steps.

Also these transformations can combine, data from multiple Dstreams, within each time step.
