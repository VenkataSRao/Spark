With availability of dataframes or schema RDD's sql operations can be easily on streaming data.. As dstream us continuous
series of RDD sql operations are performed by converting each RDD into a dataframe or schemaRDD which is registered as a
temp table..

Note:

When running sql query on streaming data the query takes 5 mins to execute, call streamingContext.. remember (minute(5))
so the data will be retained for the specified time. otherwise old streaming data might be discarded before the query can
complete ..
