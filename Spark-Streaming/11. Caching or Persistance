As in Spark batch processing streaming data can also be persistant eight in memory or in disk
In case of stateful operations, data is by default persisted in memory..

When using sources such as kafka, flume, socket etc., default persistance level is set to replicate data to two nodes for fault
tolerance.. this default persistanct level keeps data in serialized format in memory

* Window is stateful transformation
