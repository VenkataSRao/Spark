Spark is used for data science and data processing applications.

DataScience:
============

--- Machine Learning and data analysis supported through MLLib libraries
--- There is also support for external programs in MATLAB or R
--- Data frame is for data scientists

Data Processing Applications:
==================================

--- Use principles of s/w engineering such as encapusaltion, inheritance,  interface design and object oriented principles to build an applicaiton that process massive amount of data in parallel across cluster..
